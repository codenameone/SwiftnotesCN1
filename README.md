# Swiftnotes Codename One (iOS/iPhone) port

![Swiftnotes Codename One Heading](https://www.codenameone.com/img/blog/port-an-android-app-to-ios.jpg)

A port of the Android native [Swiftnotes app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moonpi.swiftnotes) to [Codename One](https://www.codenameone.com) that allows the app to run on all mobile platforms. Swiftnotes for Android is [open source](https://github.com/adrianchifor/Swiftnotes/) without their great work this would have been a harder tutorial to pull off! 

There is a full and very detailed tutorial covering this conversion in the [Codename One blog](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/port-native-android-app-ios-iphone-guide.html). You can check it out for a live preview of the app as well as install the native version from all 3 major appstores.
